/**
 * Graphology Louvain Algorithm
 * =============================
 *
 * JavaScript implementation of the Louvain algorithm for community detection
 * using the `graphology` Graph library.
 *
 * [Reference]:
 * https://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.0476v2.pdf
 *
 * [Article]:
 * Fast unfolding of communities in large networks
 * Vincent D. Blondel, Jean-Loup Guillaume, Renaud Lambiotte, Etienne Lefebvre
 *
 * [Notes]:
 * This implementation uses the altered set heuristics:
 * A set of altered communities is stored and used at each iteration of the
 * phase 1.
 * Indeed, every time a movement is made from C1 to C2, then for the next
 * iteration through every node each movement from a
 * not-altered to another not-altered community is pointless to check
 * because the âˆ†Q would be the same (negative movement then).
 * A old set is used to store the altered comm. from the previous phase 1 iteration
 * A new set is used to store the altered comm. of the current phase 1 iteration
 * A flag is used to handle the first phase-1 iteration
